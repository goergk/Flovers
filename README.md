# Flovers

## Description

Flovers - florist management system(CRUD).

My Engineerâ€™s Thesis project. React + Django (Rest Framework).

'This Web application is providing several tools to support the management of the florists. It is designed to provide users with the ability to manage their flowers, search for flowers, bouquets, deliveries and sales. It also allows displaying information about individual products, deliveries and sales. In addition, the presented tools, in the form of graphs, are to facilitate drawing conclusions from sales.'
